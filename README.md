Visualization of DTFT and its properties using LabVIEW

Graphical representation and visualization for better understanding of Discrete Fourier Transform and its properties using NI LabVIEW. Selecting diï¬€erent basic signal functions and parameters for the signals allows the user to visualize the Fourier transform and verify its properties in real time.

DTFT properties include:
Convolution
Linearity
Periodicity
TimeReversal
TimeScale
TimeShifting
